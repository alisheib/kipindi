# 50pick — Launch Go/No-Go (real money at 50pick.tz)

> The single walk-down list to take 50pick live. GBT licence ✅ (2026-07-16),
> payment keys expected 2026-07-17. Owners: 🤖 = code (me) · 👤 = Ali/ops.
> Ordered so nothing runs before its prerequisite. Companion:
> `GO-LIVE-READINESS.md`, `PAYMENT-INTEGRATION-CHECKLIST.md`.

## ✅ Already cleared
- GBT licence (the hard legal gate).
- The whole money engine: exact pari-mutuel payout (drift 0.00), **ALL money paths
  atomic** — settle/deposit/withdraw/refund AND bet placement (bet-stake single-tx
  merged @595901e, verified e2e:money 57/57 + e2e:fault 34/34 + s10) — double-entry
  ledger + trial balance, fork-proof audit chain, exactly-once webhooks. Audit +
  §9 enhancement all merged + live.

## 1 · Code to finish before real money (🤖 me)
- [ ] **Payment gateway** — wire + TEST the aggregator on `feat/payment-adapter`
      (when keys land): sandbox round-trip, reconcile to 0, merge, deploy.
      *Send me: which aggregator, API/webhook docs, base URL, key+secret.*
- [x] **bet-stake single-transaction** — DONE (merged @595901e). Every money write
      of a bet is now one atomic `$transaction`. No longer a launch consideration.
- [ ] **Activate R2 for KYC** — the seam is built; I run `npm i @aws-sdk/client-s3`,
      confirm the code path, and we do a staging KYC upload→view round-trip once
      you set the R2 creds (§2).

## 2 · Infra / hosting you provision (👤 Ali)
- [ ] **DNS → Railway (this is "go to 50pick.tz").** Follow the ⭐ cutover section in
      `CLOUDFLARE-SETUP-GUIDE.md`: finish the (existing) Cloudflare onboarding →
      swap nameservers at Netpoa → add the 4 exact records (per-host CNAME targets
      + 2 `_railway-verify` TXT), grey-cloud first. Both custom domains are ALREADY
      attached in Railway; `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is already `https://www.50pick.tz`.
- [ ] **Cloudflare R2 bucket** (e.g. `50pick-kyc`) + an R2 API token. Gives me the
      creds for §3. (If you also front the app with Cloudflare DNS/CDN/WAF, do that
      here too — recommended, not required.)
- [ ] **Redis** (Railway tile) — *only needed if you run more than one instance.*
      Single instance at launch is fine without it; add before scaling.

## 3 · Env / credentials to set in Railway (👤 Ali)
- [ ] **Payment:** `PAYMENT_AGGREGATOR` (`selcom`|`azampay`), `PAYMENT_API_KEY`,
      `PAYMENT_API_SECRET` (+ base-URL var).
- [ ] **Webhook secrets:** `AZAMPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` / `MIXX_WEBHOOK_SECRET` per
      provider enabled (`SELCOM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` already set).
- [ ] **R2:** `KYC_STORAGE=r2`, `R2_ENDPOINT`, `R2_BUCKET`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`,
      `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
- [ ] **App URL:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://www.50pick.tz`.
- [ ] **Sentry (recommended):** `SENTRY_DSN` (I add `npm i @sentry/node`).
- [ ] **Confirm already set + distinct:** `DATABASE_URL`, `USE_PRISMA_DAL=true`,
      `SESSION_SECRET` (≥32), `OTP_PEPPER` (≥16), `AUDIT_CHAIN_SECRET` (≠ session).
- [ ] **VAPID keys** — only if enabling web-push at launch (else push stays stubbed).

## 4 · Decisions to confirm (👤 Ali, quick)
- [ ] **Phone OTP / SMS at launch?** Auth today is phone + password; SMS-OTP paths
      exist but need a **TCRA-licensed SMS sender** (`SMS_PROVIDER`/`SMS_API_KEY`/
      `SMS_SENDER_ID`) to deliver. Without it: no SMS password-reset / phone
      verification. Decide if that's required for day 1 (Selcom can also do SMS).
- [ ] **TRA tax base** — commission-slice vs GGR is intentionally unresolved in
      code; confirm the ruling for the finance reports (doesn't block betting).
- [ ] **Geo-fencing / sanctions-PEP screening** — planned, not built. Confirm
      whether GBT requires either on day 1.
- [ ] **Who seals an outcome on day 1?** /admin/resolver-queue carries a
      resolution-mode toggle: **human** (the default — the AI recommends, an officer
      seals) vs **"Auto-resolve at resolve date"** (the AI seals the outcome itself
      once its confidence clears the threshold; a low-confidence or UNKNOWN read
      always falls back to the human path). In human mode, resolution is
      **single-admin by default** (one officer seals in one action); the resolver-queue
      **"Two-admin authorization"** toggle re-imposes the two-distinct-officer ceremony
      if the owner wants it (docs/COMPLIANCE-DECISIONS.md, 2026-07-24). Confirm the
      intended posture. Either way the market still pays on its own settle timer after
      the objection window — see §5.7.

## 5 · THE GO-LIVE SWITCH — run in this exact order (🤖 me + 👤 you)
1. [ ] Payment rail merged, deployed, **sandbox round-trip proven** + reconciles to 0.
2. [ ] R2 live + a KYC upload→view round-trip works.
3. [ ] Full gate on the go-live commit: `tsc` + `build` + `test:all` + `test:integrity`;
       on real PG: `s10` (double-spend), `s11` (audit fork), `money-e2e` (drift 0).
4. [ ] **Unset `TEST_FUNDING`** (stop minting un-ledgered test money). NOTE: this flips
       the platform to LIVE money-mode but no longer changes any resolution lock —
       single-admin resolution is the permanent default in all modes and two-admin
       authorization is an optional resolver-queue toggle (the old solo-resolution
       hard-lock was removed; docs/COMPLIANCE-DECISIONS.md, 2026-07-24). Also confirm
       `/admin/payments` shows **Selcom** active (not the mock simulator) for real money.
5. [ ] **Format / rebaseline the DB** → clean genesis (ledger, audit chain, wallets
       from zero; clears the test float + pre-audit rows). *This is the point where
       "clean" becomes real — after it, ANY trial-balance drift = a real defect.*
6. [ ] Verify on the fresh DB: trial balance = **TZS 0 drift**, audit chain verifies,
       a real small deposit→bet→settle→withdraw round-trip is correct end-to-end.
7. [ ] **Settlement — nothing to flip; verify instead.** There is no `AUTO_SETTLE` env
       var and no auto-settle admin toggle any more: each adjudicated market arms its
       own timer at its `objectionsClosedAt` and pays itself then (a ~5-minute
       reconciler re-arms any market whose timer was dropped). So on the go-live commit,
       **check /admin/system → "Settlement"**: "Timers armed" is non-zero with a sane
       "next fire", and **"Ready to settle" is 0** — a count that *sits* above 0 means
       timers were dropped and players are not being paid. **/admin/settlement** stays
       the human fallback (manual settle + the objection-frozen view). The payout gates
       are unchanged: objection window, a standing objection freezes the pool,
       winner-floor, exact conservation, idempotency (no double-pay). This supersedes
       the old "automatic payout is paused, every payout is a manual officer action"
       posture — see `docs/COMPLIANCE-DECISIONS.md` (2026-07-24).
8. [x] Repoint DNS confirmed: `https://50pick.tz` serves the app (not Apache) with a
       valid cert; verify + `railway logs` clean. **DONE** — cutover 2026-07-17,
       re-verified 2026-07-20 (`server: railway-hikari`, `x-powered-by: Next.js`).

## 6 · Strongly recommended before holding customer funds (👤 arrange)
- [ ] Third-party **penetration test**.
- [ ] **Backup + restore rehearsal** (prove you can recover the money DB).

---
### Shortest honest answer to "what do I need?"
**Tomorrow:** payment keys → I wire + test the rail. **You provision:** DNS repoint
50pick.tz→Railway, a Cloudflare R2 bucket + creds, and the env vars in §3.
**I finish:** bet-stake atomicity + R2 activation + the go-live DB reset. **Then** we
run §5 in order and you're live. Everything else (Redis, Sentry, pentest, SMS) is
recommended/optional, not a hard gate for a single-instance launch.
