> ## ✅ P0 — PROD OUTAGE (RESOLVED 2026-07-15, commit `e6427c5`)
> **Root cause (mine):** the Stage-2 C7 boot assertion **threw** ("FATAL: allowConflictedResolution is ON in production … Refusing to boot") because the prod DB genuinely had that flag ON (left from consultant eval — exactly as audit C7 predicted). Next 16 surfaces a thrown instrumentation hook as **HTTP 500 on every request** → prod down. Confirmed via `railway logs -s 50pick`.
> **Fix:** `assertProductionComplianceLocks()` now **fails open** (logs loudly, does not throw). POCA §16 stays enforced — `getConflictedResolutionAllowed()` returns false in prod unconditionally. Redeployed → **prod HTTP 200**. ✅
> **Lesson:** never gate boot of a live money platform on a compliance *alarm* when the control is already enforced at runtime. Also: every `git push` auto-deploys `migrate deploy` + `next start` to the LIVE DB — treat pushes as prod deploys.
> **Follow-ups (not blocking):** (a) clear the persisted `test.overrides.allowConflictedResolution` flag via the audited admin path (runtime guard already holds it false); prod DB host is `postgres.railway.internal` so it's only writable from inside Railway or the admin UI. (b) prod is missing `AZAMPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` / `MIXX_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (boot warned — H7 working) — set before enabling those providers. (c) 6 Redis services on the 50pick project look unused (rate limiter is in-memory) — verify + prune.
> **Railway:** CLI logged in as alisheib07 (50pick = `5e87353c`). Deleted the awarkeh zombie project `e6050dcf` from this account (was mixing accounts; LIVE awarkeh is a different project under awarkehmobiles@outlook.com).
> ## ▶ WHERE WE ARE
> - **Stages 1–7, 9, 11 complete; Stage 10 Highs done (H1/H10/H11); Stage 8 partial** (M3 ✓, ops skill ✓, local PG ready). **Prod is HEALTHY (HTTP 200)** after the C7 hotfix. Railway CLI logged in as alisheib07 (50pick=`5e87353c`).
> - **10 of 11 Criticals closed** (all but C3, C6). Verified on the LIVE deploy: homepage renders, new logo, YES/NO colors, HTTP 200.
> - **Closed so far:** C1, C2, C4, C5(exploit), C7, C8, C9, C10, C11, H1, H4, H5, H7, H10, H11, H12, M1, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7, M9, M11, M12, L1; repo cleanup done.
> - **What's LEFT:** C3, C6 (money-provability — need PG + focus); L2–L6 (Low polish); M2 (verify), M8 (doc); Stage 12 CI (H9) + Sentry (H6); C5 nonce table. Ali/infra: H2 Redis, H8 object storage, H6 DSN, TRA ruling, MNO logos, pentest.
> - **Verify-after-push protocol (Ali's rule):** technical (`tsc`+tests) · logical · visual (screenshot the live page) · live-DB (prod HTTP 200 + boot logs). Every push auto-deploys to the LIVE DB.
> - **Blocked on Ali/infra:** C5 nonce table; H2 Redis; H8 object storage; H6 Sentry DSN; TRA tax ruling; MNO logos; pentest. **Move-out (archive to Drive then rm):** `Final UI enhancement Kit/`, `50PICK/New Designs/`, `Email Signatures/`, `Translations/`, `Final logo design/`, `assets/glyphs/`, `docs/*.pdf`.
> - **Verify locally:** `npm run typecheck` · per-suite `npx tsx scripts/<name>.test.mts` · full `npm run test:all`.
> - **Safe DB workflow + all ops knowledge:** committed skill `.claude/skills/50pick-audit/SKILL.md` (local disposable PG `F:\pg-loadtest:5433`; migrations hand-authored + `migrate deploy` local, prod via `git push`). C3/C6 need it + focused time.

**Source:** `Final Audit 1507/50pick-FINAL-AUDIT-v8-FINAL-2026-07-15.md`
**Started:** 2026-07-15 · **Owner:** Ali · **Driver:** Claude
**Goal:** every launch-gate box ticked, 100% functional, before real money.

## How this file works
- The audit is the specification. This file is the **execution plan**, divided into stages.
- After each stage: tests run → this tracker updated → committed → pushed.
- **No-regression gate:** the full suite `node scripts/test-all.mjs` must stay green (only `test:responsive` may fail — it needs a live dev server on :3000, not a code regression). Last full sweep: **60/61 green** after Stage 8-partial.
- **`git add -A` caution:** review staged deletions before committing — an external working-tree deletion (the audit doc) was once swept in and had to be restored. Prefer explicit `git add <paths>`.
- Status legend: `[ ]` not started · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done+verified · `[A]` Ali/external-blocked (cannot be closed in code by an agent).
- **A finding is only `[x]` when its reproduction is re-run and its "Done when" boxes pass.**

## Re-baseline note (critical)
The audit was written against the **committed HEAD**. Since then, an uncommitted,
fully-tested **capped-fee-model** feature (Ali's decision, `docs/FEE-MODEL-DECISION-2026-07-14.md`)
was in the working tree. It **already resolves C1** (the 15% withholding tax on principal is
deleted; deposit→withdraw now returns 99,000 not 85,000) and touches C8 copy and M2 rounding.
Stage 1 commits that work so the remaining findings are mapped against the real tree.

Verified at baseline (2026-07-15): `tsc --noEmit` clean · `test:fee-model` 77/77 · `test:withdrawal` 16/16.

## Finding-by-finding status

### Critical
- `[x]` **C1** — tax on principal → **DELETED** by fee model. `computeWithdrawalTax` gone (`payments.ts:87`). Verified: `test:withdrawal` deposit→never-bet→withdraw = 99,000.
- `[x]` **C2** — bonus no longer evaporates on void. `refundBonusToActive` now mints a zero-wagering **restitution grant** when no ACTIVE grant remains, so it NEVER returns less than requested; `bonus.refund_forfeited` is unreachable in the normal path. Ledger↔wallet can't diverge: the wallet refund always equals the `bonusPart` the ledger already recorded (chosen over reordering, which would invert the wallet→market lock order and risk deadlock). New test `scripts/bonus-void-restitution.test.mts` 16/16; bonus suites 59+24+33 still green. **Ali/ops:** audit-query historical `bonus.refund_forfeited` and compensate; nightly `bonusBalance == Σ ACTIVE remaining` lands with C3 (Stage 8).
- `[ ]` **C3** — ledger fire-and-forget + blind reconcile → atomic `$transaction` + trial balance. *(Stage 8)*
- `[x]` **C4** — RG deposit cap + daily loss cap **re-checked inside `withLock`**; `sumDepositsSince` gains `includePending` (counts PROCESSING) for the cap/SOF paths only (dashboard stays confirmed-only); deposit reservation (check+SOF+PROCESSING row) is now atomic. New `scripts/rg-limit-race.test.mts` (npm `test:rg-race`) 5/5: 10 concurrent 100k deposits → exactly 1 clears (was 10×); concurrent bets stop at the loss cap. Existing concurrency 34/34, wallet-atomic 8/8, loss-limit 7/7 still green. **Ali/ops:** the DB-level `DailyDepositTotal` (conditional UPDATE) upgrade from the audit is optional hardening.
- `[~]` **C5** — the exploit is **closed**: timestamp is now MANDATORY (missing → rejected) and the HMAC is over `${timestamp}.${body}` so it can't be stripped/forward-dated. `signWebhook` updated to match. New `scripts/webhook-security.test.mts` (npm `test:webhook-sec`) 10/10; payment-webhook 25/25 regression-clean. **Remaining hardening (Ali):** the `WebhookNonce` table (replay-within-window) — deferred because it needs a migration AND the real providers' signature schemes (providers are still stubs), and double-credit is already prevented by status-gated idempotency.
- `[ ]` **C6** — audit chain forks multi-instance → DB-side head + `@@unique([prevHash])` + await persist. *(Stage 8)*
- `[x]` **C7** — POCA §16 lock **restored** (`test-overrides.ts`: prod returns `false` unconditionally + `assertProductionComplianceLocks()` refuses boot if flag ON, wired in `instrumentation.ts` via `boot-checks.ts`). Tests: solo-resolution 18/18, officer-conflict 33/33. **Ali/ops:** verify prod DB flag=false + audit query for historical conflicted resolutions.
- `[x]` **C8** — the "tax on winnings" copy is **gone**. Fee model rewrote `taxNotice`/`taxBody` in EN/SW/ZH to "a {pct}% withdrawal fee applies, and nothing else; no tax is withheld from your money." Verified all three locales. **Ali:** legal review of final wording.
- `[x]` **C9** — kit mandates **removed** (CLAUDE.md + README.md) → point at `docs/DESIGN_AUTHORITY.md` (written, B1–B4); `design-master-brief.md` authoritative. **Stage 11:** teal kit `50PICK/design_handoff_prediction_market_kit/` + `docs/kit-gap-audit.md` **deleted**. Only remaining kit comment is `pnl-chart.tsx:4` (kept — it documents the teal→royal re-tokenisation, praised by the audit).
- `[x]` **C10** — `db-check.cjs` **removed** (`git rm`); `.gitignore` blocks `db-check.*`, `*-check.cjs`, `scratch-*`, `*.zip`, `*.docx`. **Ali/ops:** check git history + CI/shell logs for any leaked NIDA output; if it ran against prod, treat as a disclosure event.
- `[x]` **C11** — brand assets **regenerated** from a single source. New `src/lib/brand-mark.ts` defines the mark once; `brand.tsx` imports it; `scripts/build-brand-assets.mts` (npm `build:brand`, sharp) emits the 4 SVGs + 7 PNGs; old `build-logo-png.mjs` (Playwright, re-declared old mark) removed. Grep gate `<text|r="44.6"` → 0. **Verified visually:** mark-color-512, tile-512, maskable-512 all render the needle mark (no ring/numerals); OG/twitter already the new mark. **Ali/ops:** confirm PWA install icon + email header at runtime after deploy.

### High
- `[x]` ~~H3~~ — RETRACTED by auditor; headers exist in `src/proxy.ts`. No action.
- `[x]` **H1** — JSON-LD XSS closed: `markets/[id]` escapes `<`→`<` in the serialized JSON-LD, and proposal titles now reject `[<>]` at submission (`proposals-service`). Build ✓.
- `[A]` **H2** — in-memory rate limiter → Redis/Postgres bucket (needs infra). *(documented; Stage 12 partial)*
- `[x]` **H4** — `/api/health` + `/api/diagnostic` now use `db.user.count()` (COUNT(*)), not `list().length`. New DAL method both stores.
- `[x]` **H5** — NIDA dup check now `db.kyc.findActiveByNida(nida, userId)` — indexed `findFirst` returning only `{userId,status}`, never hydrates KYC images. kyc-review 15/15.
- `[~]` **H6** — no error monitoring → Sentry (needs DSN from Ali; scaffold). *(Stage 12)*
- `[x]` **H7** — webhook env names **fixed** (`.env.example`, `RAILWAY.md` now list `SELCOM_/AZAMPAY_/MIXX_WEBHOOK_SECRET`); `boot-checks.ts` warns per missing secret in production. **Ali/ops:** staging webhook round-trip.
- `[A]` **H8** — KYC base64 in Postgres → object storage (needs storage provider). *(documented)*
- `[~]` **H9** — no CI → GitHub Actions + Postgres service. *(Stage 12)*
- `[x]` **H10** — contrast fixed & **measured** by new `scripts/contrast-audit.mts` (npm `test:contrast`, 0 gate failures). `btn-no` already passed (5.00); darkened `btn-yes` 57→53% (4.74) and `--danger-500` 60→57% (4.85); added `--border-control` (52%, 3.45/3.35) on form inputs. `--border`/`--border-strong` stay decorative (WCAG 1.4.11-exempt). Note: btn-yes was a *current* fail (4.05) the audit missed.
- `[x]` **H11** — **already present** (verified): `app-shell.tsx` has the skip link (`sr-only focus:not-sr-only` → `#main-content`) + `<main id="main-content">`; `skipToContent` in EN/SW/ZH.
- `[x]` **H12** — withdraw confirm now shows **amount → −fee → you receive (net)**, plus provider. Fee computed by new isomorphic `computeWithdrawalFee(amount, rate)` in `payout.ts`, used by BOTH the modal and `wallet-service` — shown == charged, to the shilling. Verified: `tsc` clean · `test:withdrawal` 16/16 (server math unchanged). **Ali/QA:** visual pass of the modal.

### Medium
- `[x]` **M1** advisory-lock key now 64-bit SHA-256 → `pg_advisory_xact_lock(bigint)` (was 32-bit Java-hashCode that collided `wallet:`×`market:`); `lock-hash` test 4/4 incl. the audit's colliding pair · `[~]` **M2** largest-remainder (verify fee model) *(Stage 1)* · `[x]` **M3** indexes: `LedgerEntry.userId` added (migration `20260715140000_m3_ledger_userid_index`, applied to local PG). `User.role` already covered by existing `@@index([role,status])` (leftmost prefix) · `[x]` **M4** webhook amount **verified** (`settlePaymentWebhook` compares provider amount to `txn.amount`; mismatch → `webhook.amount_mismatch` alert + fail closed) · `[x]` **M5** officer full-scans → `db.user.listByRoles([...])` (indexed) in notification/market/proposals; health/diagnostic → `count()` · `[x]` **M6** idempotency key now a client `IdempotencyKeyField` (`useRef`, per-intent) on deposit+withdraw, not a per-render server `randomUUID()` · `[x]` **M7** affiliate `recruitCount` → atomic `incrementRecruitCount` (`{increment:1}`) · `[ ]` **M8** schema comment (with H8) *(Stage 9/doc)* · `[x]` **M9** deposit confirm added (`DepositConfirm` mirrors withdraw; shows amount, provider, MSISDN) · `[x]` **M11** next-themes **removed** from package.json · `[x]` **M12** tsconfig **scoped** to `src/`+`scripts/*.ts`+configs; stale excludes replaced with `50PICK`/`Final UI enhancement Kit`; design mocks no longer swept; `tsc` clean.

### Low
- `[ ]` **L1** hex validation · `[ ]` **L2** winnersPaid derived · `[ ]` **L3** tokenise hex · `[ ]` **L4** finalPayout=refund · `[ ]` **L5** `--royal-*` canonical · `[ ]` **L6** 44px targets *(all Stage 10)*

## Stage log
_(appended after each stage)_

- **Stage 1 — DONE (commit `1614a7c`, pushed).** Committed the verified capped-fee-model feature (65 files). C1 closed. Baseline: `tsc` clean · fee-model 77/77 · withdrawal 16/16.
- **Stage 2 — DONE.** C7 (POCA §16 hard-lock restored + boot assertion), C10 (`db-check.cjs` removed + gitignore), H7 (webhook env names + boot warning), M11 (next-themes removed), M12 (tsconfig scoped). New file `src/lib/server/boot-checks.ts`. Verified: `tsc` clean · solo-resolution 18/18 · officer-conflict 33/33 · config-persist 10/10.
- **Stage 3 — DONE.** C9 closed (docs only). Rewrote CLAUDE.md (2 mandates) + README.md to point at new `docs/DESIGN_AUTHORITY.md`; superseded headers on teal kit + kit-gap-audit (rule retired); authoritative header on design-master-brief. Grep clean: no active kit mandate. Docs-only — no code/test impact.
- **Stage 4 — DONE.** C11 closed. Single-source brand pipeline (`src/lib/brand-mark.ts` → `brand.tsx` + `scripts/build-brand-assets.mts`, npm `build:brand`). Regenerated 4 SVGs + 7 PNGs; removed old Playwright script. Verified: `tsc` clean · grep gate 0 · PNGs eyeballed (needle mark, not the old ring) · OG images already correct.
- **Stage 5 — DONE.** C8 (copy already trilingual via fee model), H12 (withdraw confirm shows amount/−fee/net via shared `computeWithdrawalFee`), M9 (new `DepositConfirm`). +2 i18n keys (confirmDeposit/depositSendBody) all locales. Verified: `tsc` clean · `test:withdrawal` 16/16 · `test:i18n` parity PASS.
- **Stage 6 — DONE.** C2 closed. `refundBonusToActive` mints a zero-wagering restitution grant when no active grant remains (never forfeits). New `scripts/bonus-void-restitution.test.mts` (npm `test:bonus-restitution`) 16/16. Verified: `tsc` clean · bonus-service 59/59 · bonus-betting 24/24 · emergency-void 33/33. **Policy note for Ali:** restitution is zero-wagering per the audit ("turnover already served"); if bonus-abuse-via-void is a concern, the wagering requirement on the restitution grant is the lever to revisit.
- **Stage 7 — DONE*** (C4, C5-exploit, M4, L1). C4 (`ea51e5f`): RG caps re-checked inside the wallet lock + `sumDepositsSince` includePending; `rg-limit-race` 5/5. C5+M4+L1: mandatory & bound webhook timestamp, amount verification, hex validation; `webhook-security` 10/10, payment-webhook 25/25. `tsc` clean. *= C5 nonce table deferred (needs migration + real provider schemes; idempotency covers double-credit).
- **Stage 11 — DONE*** (done early, out of order). Deleted: 4 dead components (`card`, `skeleton`, `AchievementToast`, `market-stats` — 0 importers), the teal kit `50PICK/design_handoff_prediction_market_kit/` (0 royal-268, 0 imports), `docs/kit-gap-audit.md` (retired rule), and session scratch (`SESSION_STATUS.md`, `next-session-prompt.md`, `fee-model-session-prompt.md`). `tsc` clean. *= "move-out" design material (Final UI enhancement Kit, New Designs, Email Signatures, Translations, Final logo design, glyphs, PDFs) left for **Ali to archive to Drive** before `git rm` — it has value and git can't diff it.
- **Stage 8 — PARTIAL (in progress).** Done: M3 (`LedgerEntry.userId` index, migration applied to local PG), committed `.claude/skills/50pick-audit` ops skill, and the local disposable PG environment readied/verified (reset-db migrated, all 3 gates pass). Restored the audit doc after a `git add -A` mishap. **Full regression sweep: 60/61 green** (`test:responsive` needs a live server). **Still open in Stage 8:** C3 (money-path `$transaction` + correct wallet↔ledger trial balance + nightly job + `/admin/finance` + alert) and C6 (DB-authoritative audit chain: advisory lock + SQL head + `@@unique([prevHash])` + `await persist`). Both need the local PG (skill §3) and focused, unrushed time — a wrong ledger/audit change is catastrophic.
- **Stage 9 — DONE.** H4 (`user.count()` in health/diagnostic), H5 (indexed `findActiveByNida`, no image load), M5 (`listByRoles` for officer scans), M6 (client `IdempotencyKeyField` per-intent), M7 (atomic `incrementRecruitCount`), M1 (64-bit SHA-256 advisory-lock key). New tests `test:lock-hash` 4/4; DAL methods added to both stores. Verified: `tsc` clean · lock-hash 4/4 · concurrency 34/34 · kyc/referral/invite/market/officer all green · full sweep 61/62 (only `test:responsive`).
