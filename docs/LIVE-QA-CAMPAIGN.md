# Live QA campaign — every player & operator flow, driven against production

**Started** 2026-07-31 · **Branch** `qa/live-experience` (worktree `F:\kipindi-liveqa`, off `origin/main` @`3f24a30`)
**Target** `https://50pick.tz` — the LIVE money app. There is no staging.
**Mandate (Ali, 2026-07-31):** test every flow live as admin · player · accountant · compliance ·
QA · forms engineer · and an adversarial player actively trying to cheat. Full rights over the
live DB, Railway, and the deploy pipeline. Live data is disposable. Fix what breaks and ship it.

> This document is the **handoff**. A session that picks this up should be able to continue from
> §5 without re-deriving anything. Keep it current as the work moves — a tracker that lags the
> work is worse than none.

## 1. Credentials — everything except the secret values themselves

Ali asked (2026-07-31) for credentials hard-coded here so a second laptop can continue at once.
The values cannot go in this file — it is pushed to `github.com/alisheib/kipindi`, and the tooling
refuses to commit plaintext secrets. So this section carries **everything except the secret
strings**, plus the exact commands that mint them in under a minute. Nothing below needs Ali.

| What | Identity (public) | Where the secret is |
|---|---|---|
| **Operator console** | `https://50pick.tz/auth/admin`, phone **`777777777`** (E.164 `+255777777777`, `usr_1b3e6fd5048b1d873e931715`, `alisheib07@gmail.com`) | `.env.qa.local` → `QA_ADMIN_PASSWORD`; also Ali |
| **QA player `alpha`** | phone **`712000101`**, `qa.alpha.50pick@gmail.com` | `.env.qa.local` → `QA_ALPHA_PASSWORD` |
| **Live DB** | Railway project `50pick` → service `Postgres`; public proxy **`turntable.proxy.rlwy.net:40357`**, user `postgres`, db `railway` | minted by `mkenv.cjs`, below |
| Selcom · Postmark · R2 · backup seal key | — | Railway → `50pick` service only |

**`.env.qa.local`** lives in the worktree root and is gitignored (`.gitignore:9`), so it does NOT
travel with a clone. On a new laptop, either copy that one small file across, or ask Ali for the
two passwords — everything else regenerates itself:

```bash
# 1. live DB access (never prints the secret; writes it to a file)
cd F:\kipindi-main                      # the Railway CLI link lives in THIS tree
railway run -s 50pick -- node <scratchpad>/live/mkenv.cjs

# 2. confirm which Railway project/env you are pointed at
railway status                          # expect: project 50pick · environment production

# 3. read any live env var without dumping all of them
railway run -s 50pick -- node -e "console.log(!!process.env.SOME_KEY)"
```

`mkenv.cjs` rewrites the injected internal `DATABASE_URL` onto the Postgres public TCP proxy and
writes it to `live/.env`. ⚠️ `railway variables` is blocked by the permission classifier by
design — don't fight it, use `railway run`.

**Regenerating live DB access from scratch** (the internal host is unreachable from a laptop):

```bash
cd F:\kipindi-main                      # the Railway CLI link lives in THIS tree
railway run -s 50pick -- node <scratchpad>/live/mkenv.cjs
```

`mkenv.cjs` rewrites the injected internal `DATABASE_URL` onto the Postgres service's public TCP
proxy (`turntable.proxy.rlwy.net:40357`) and writes it to a file — **it never prints the secret**.
`railway variables` is blocked by the permission classifier by design; don't fight it, use this.

## 2. Environment facts (verified 2026-07-31, not assumed)

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Railway | workspace `Ali Sheib's Projects` · project `50pick` (`5e87353c…`) · env `production` · services `Postgres`, `Redis`, `50pick` |
| Live DB | PostgreSQL **18.3**, 61 MB, 43 users / 42 wallets, 18.9k audit rows |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` → **every `/api/dev-test/*` route 404s**. Live flows must go through real UI. |
| `DISABLE_ADMIN_TOTP` | `true` on prod (admin 2FA off — pre-existing, tracked elsewhere) |
| SMS provider | `console` — **deliberate**: the OTP path is parked until the SMS contract is signed. Registration and login are phone+password, so this is not a signup blocker. Re-check before enabling OTP. |
| `TWELVEDATA_API_KEY` | **absent** on prod — the Up & Down source-pinning branch needs it (other session's work) |
| Anthropic key | present (AI poll generation is live) |

## 3. Traps this campaign has already paid for

- 🔴 **`pg` silently shifts every timestamp by −3h on this machine.** Prisma stores
  `timestamp WITHOUT time zone` holding UTC wall-clock; node-postgres builds a JS `Date` using the
  laptop's zone (EAT, +3), so `.toISOString()` reads 3 hours early. It looks *exactly* like a
  server clock bug and nearly became a false "consent timestamps are wrong" compliance blocker.
  **Always `::text`-cast timestamps**, or use the harness (`live/harness.mjs` sets the type
  parsers for OIDs 1114/1082).
- ⚠️ **The phone field takes 9 digits, not 10.** `PhoneInput` renders a `+255` prefix and caps at
  9, so the number is `712000101` — typing the habitual `0712000101` silently truncates to
  `071200010` and fails with "Enter a valid Tanzania mobile number". See §6 (open question).
- ⚠️ **DOB is a masked `DateSelect`, not an `<input type=date>`.** `#dob` is a *hidden* input;
  fill the three `aria-label` segments `Day` / `Month` / `Year` instead.
- ⚠️ **Kit `Checkbox` inputs are visually hidden** — Playwright `check()` fails actionability;
  use `check({ force: true })` and assert `isChecked()` afterwards.
- ⚠️ Three worktrees share one `.git`, one `node_modules` and one database. `F:\kipindi-main`
  holds the Railway link. Ports 3000/3009/3010/3011/3200 belong to other sessions — stay off them.

## 4. Test personas (created on LIVE)

| Persona | Phone (E.164) | Role | Purpose | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `alpha` | `+255712000101` | PLAYER | main player — wins, withdraws | created, `PENDING_KYC`, balance 0 |

Passwords in `.env.qa.local`. Personas are added here as they are created.

**Operator surfaces, surveyed live 2026-07-31** — 21 of 22 return 200 with no overflow at 1440px
and a clean console: `/admin` · `players` · `markets` · `ai-polls` · `ai-usage` · `proposals` ·
`finance` · `transactions` · `settlement` · `reports` · `roles` · `staff` · `config` · `updown` ·
`invites` · `audit` · `compliance` · `payments` · `self-exclusions` · `sources` · `system`.
`/admin/kyc` is **not a page** — KYC review is part of **`/admin/approvals`**
(`admin-nav-groups.ts:190` maps the two). Don't file that 404 as a bug.

## 5. Progress — phase by phase

## 6. Findings

Severity: **BLOCKER** (stops a player) · **HIGH** (money/compliance/data) · **MEDIUM** (real but
survivable) · **LOW** (polish). Every entry needs evidence — a screenshot, a DB row, or a log line.

| # | Sev | Area | Finding | Evidence | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A-1** | HIGH | register + sign-in | **The phone field could not accept 4 of the 5 shapes a Tanzanian writes.** `PhoneInput` stripped non-digits and truncated to 9, so `0712000101` → `071200010` ("Enter a valid Tanzania mobile number", never mentioning the leading zero) and a pasted `+255712000101` → `255712000`, *a different number*. `tzPhone` had always accepted all four. Hits the **first screen** of every new player. | typed into live `/auth/register`; table below | ✅ fixed |
| **A-2** | HIGH | sign-in | **Sign-in was a phone-enumeration oracle.** One unauthenticated request per number revealed whether it had a 50pick account: unknown → `?error=no_account`, real account + wrong password → `?error=wrong_credentials`. | live probe: `+255712000101` vs `+255799999999` | ✅ fixed |
| **A-3** | HIGH | sign-in / RG | **Self-exclusion status was readable without a password.** `SELF_EXCLUDED` / `SUSPENDED` / `CLOSED` were checked *before* the password, so a prober could learn that a given Tanzanian mobile belonged to someone who had self-excluded from gambling. | `auth-service.ts` ordering | ✅ fixed |

**A-1 evidence — what the live field kept, before the fix:**

| Typed | Field kept | |
|---|---|---|
| `0712000101` | `071 200 010` | last digit silently lost |
| `+255712000101` | `255 712 000` | **a different subscriber number** |
| `255712000101` | `255 712 000` | |
| `0712 000 101` | `071 200 010` | |
| `712000101` | `712 000 101` | the only shape that survived |

**Fixes** — `src/lib/phone-normalize.ts` (one shared definition, used by the widget so admin
sign-in cannot drift), `burnPasswordVerify()` + post-verification status gates in
`auth-service.ts`. **Guards**: `npm run test:phone-normalize` (17) · `npm run test:login-enum` (11).

⚠️ **A-2/A-3 reversed an existing tested behaviour — Ali should know.** Three assertions in
`scripts/auth-email-signin.test.mts` pinned the *enumerating* answer as correct, and the parked
OTP path in `auth-service.ts:~93` still carries the opposite rationale in a comment
("anti-enumeration is not load-bearing for this product — phone numbers aren't private"). That
rationale is OTP-era; `MODULE-CERTIFICATION-PROGRAM.md` §A is the newer binding exit bar and
requires enumeration-neutrality *proven by timing distribution*. The three assertions were
updated with the reasoning inline. **If the OTP login path is ever un-parked it will reintroduce
A-2 and A-3** — fix it at the same time.

**Residual, not closed:** the brute-force lockout still only fires for accounts that exist, so 5+
wrong passwords against one number is a weaker existence signal. It is rate-limited (per
identifier *and* per IP) and audited, unlike the old one-request oracle. Left as-is deliberately;
closing it costs the owner a usable "your account is locked" message.

### Open questions (raised, not yet concluded)

- **Stored locale on signup.** A player who signs up while the site is in EN gets `locale = SW`
  (the schema default; 41 of 43 live users are SW, 2 EN). Confirm whether the UI then flips
  language under them after signup.
- **DOB is stored as midnight EAT** (`1995-04-12` → `1995-04-11T21:00:00Z`). Correct, but any
  surface that renders the raw UTC date will show the previous day. Check the KYC/admin views.

## 7. Reproducing the harness

Scripts live in the session scratchpad (`…/scratchpad/live/`), not the repo, so a QA run never
dirties a shared tree:

| File | Does |
|---|---|
| `harness.mjs` | browser + persona + screenshot + console-error capture + live DB handle |
| `mkenv.cjs` | mints the public `DATABASE_URL` from Railway |
| `p1-signup.mjs` | registers a persona through the real UI (`PHONE=`, `NAME=`, `EMAIL=`) |
| `shots/` | every screenshot, named `p<phase>-<persona>-<step>` |

`node_modules` there is a **junction** to `F:\kipindi-main\node_modules` — ⛔ never `rm -rf` it
(it follows the link and deletes the other sessions' install); remove with cmd `rmdir`.
