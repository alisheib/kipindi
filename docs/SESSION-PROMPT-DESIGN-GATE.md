# SESSION PROMPT — implement THE DESIGN GATE to 100%

**Programme key: `DESIGN-GATE-2026-08-28`** — quote this key in commits and handoffs so any
session, on any machine, knows which programme it is inside. Owner: Ali. Commissioned 2026-08-28:
*“100% consistency among the platform … your report should be the final gate to a perfectly
rendered platform.”*

## ▶ START HERE (any machine)
1. `git pull` on `main` (F:\kipindi-main on the original PC; any clone works — the evidence
   regenerates). `npm install` after every pull. ⚠️ Two sessions may share this tree — read
   `.claude/skills/50pick-standards/SKILL.md` §8b before committing anything.
2. Read, in order:
   - [DESIGN-GATE-ADMIN-2026-08-28.md](DESIGN-GATE-ADMIN-2026-08-28.md) — 23 systems `DG-A-01…23`, §6 is the work order.
   - [DESIGN-GATE-PLAYER-2026-08-28.md](DESIGN-GATE-PLAYER-2026-08-28.md) — 14 systems `DG-P-01…14`, §6 is the work order.
   - [DESIGN_AUTHORITY.md](DESIGN_AUTHORITY.md) §0 before writing ANY design value anywhere.
3. The measuring instruments are **in the repo**: `scripts/design-gate/measure.mjs`,
   `overlays.mjs`, `shots.mjs`, `analyze.mjs`, `redo.cjs`, `AUDIT-BRIEF.md`. They run against
   production read-only and write to `.qa-design-gate/` (gitignored). Credentials come from
   `.env.qa.local` (never tracked; per-machine — see the memory note “QA logins stale again”).

## The work, in order (details in each report’s §6)
| Step | What | Systems |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Kit primitives (one file each, whole classes close at once): toggle hit-area · select true-32 + no-wrap · search popover unclip · input sm rung · NavLink hover · ScrollX affordance · AdminKpi re-token + neutral delta · SortTh · chart axis layer · pagination wrap | DG-A-02/03/04/05/07/10/15/17/23 · DG-P-01/02 |
| 2 | Tokens & classes: type-ladder ruling (⚠️ Ali picks: bless 12.5 as `--type-table` or move tables to 13) · three label classes · card rungs · sidebar active token + 40px items + `<main>` landmark · section-rhythm | DG-A-11/12/16/18 · DG-P-04/05/06 |
| 3 | Sweeps: dense filter rows → one recipe · rails → FilterPill · row-actions · cell-hover removal · copy/enum sweep · prose floor · colour semantics (§B11 + no betting ink on actions) · h1 discipline · tap-floor residue · truncation disclosures · board chip migration · aria-current reach | DG-A-04/06/08/09/13/14/21 · DG-P-03/07/08/10/11 |
| 4 | Singles: `/admin/reports` 88 s load · React #310 on authed `/auth/login` · layout balance · skeletons last | DG-A-01/20/22 · DG-P-09/12/13/14 |

**Definition of done per step:** `npx tsc --noEmit` clean · `npm run test:ui-consistency` ·
`npm run test:design-frozen` · `npm run test:contrast` · `npm run test:tokens` ·
`npm run test:filter-language` green — then **re-measure**: run the drive for the touched
surface and diff the analyzer section that step owns. A step is done when its RED line in the
report’s §6 gate list is GREEN **on production**, not on localhost.

## ⛔ Traps this programme has already paid for (do not re-pay)
- **One login per account at a time.** The platform keeps ONE live session per account; a second
  Playwright login revokes the first mid-run and every later page “succeeds” as the sign-in page
  at HTTP 200 (`?revoked=1` in the URL is the tell). Chain drives per account:
  `measure → overlays → shots` in ONE background command; admin and alpha may run in parallel.
- `redo.cjs <surface>` finds and deletes poisoned records (checks `finalUrl` + h1) — run it after
  every drive before believing the data.
- Player pages hold an SSE stream open → never `waitUntil: "networkidle"`; the scripts already
  use `load` + a bounded settle.
- Git Bash rewrites a lone `/` (and sometimes the first element) in `ONLY=` env lists —
  `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` on every invocation that passes routes.
- The Tailwind spacing scale is overridden and **inverts at `.5` steps**; `rounded-pill` on a
  `.btn` is inert; a bounding box cannot see a hit-area fix (`elementFromPoint` can).
- The 40px `.mcardp-actions .btn` and 44px `.pchart-range` literals are **rulings** (globals.css
  3503 / 2644) — do not “normalise” them.
- Deliberately out of scope, Ali’s standing calls: numeric radius scale; `--h-control-*` /
  `--type-nano` raises; density toggle; search typeahead (NEXT-PLAN §8.8).

## Claude Design commission
The visual-taste questions this gate cannot settle by measurement (admin dense-rung look, KPI
tile art direction, the label type ramp) are packaged for Claude Design at
`design-brief/design-gate-2026-08-28/PROMPT-claude-design.md` (tracked while the round is under
review — DESIGN_AUTHORITY §0b OUTBOUND row). Send it, file the delivery under
`docs/design-system/` as an incoming commission, then **delete the folder and its `.gitignore`
exception** — §0b’s own rule.

## 🧹 DELETE WHEN DONE (Ali’s instruction, 2026-08-28)
When every row above is ✅ and the gate re-measures green on production:
- delete `.qa-design-gate/` and any leftover `.qa-design-adminscan/` output (evidence, regenerable);
- delete `design-brief/design-gate-2026-08-28/` + its `.gitignore` exception (once the round is sent);
- mark the two `DESIGN-GATE-*` reports’ headers **⚪ SPENT** (keep the files — they are the record);
- update the memory note `50pick-design-gate` to CLOSED.
