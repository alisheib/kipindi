/**
 * THE ONE HOUSE-BOT ABSENCE VOCABULARY (owner ruling D19; C5-SPEC ruling 175).
 *
 * ⛔ WHY ONE MODULE. The words an absence proof looks for were written three times — in `test:house-bot-disclosure`,
 * `verify:house-bot-bundle` and `qa:house-bot-holder-view` — and the copies drifted (`house[ -]?bots?` against
 * `house[_ -]?bots?`; `HouseBot\w*` against `HouseBot[A-Z]\w*`), so two guards could disagree about the same file.
 * Every absence consumer imports this module and declares no word or identifier pattern of its own; a pin in
 * `test:house-bot-reports` §0 refuses one that does. Suites whose lists are deliberately BROADER (the seam's notice
 * pins, the money suite's notice words) build them with `extendHouseWords`, so the shared words stay a subset.
 *
 * Plain `.mjs` so `node` (the bundle scan) and `tsx` (every suite) import the same file.
 *
 * ⛔ WHAT IT NEVER CONTAINS:
 *   · bare `house` — `/admin/house` is `main`'s own owner book and nav label (`admin-nav-groups.ts`);
 *   · a raw `hb_` or `hbi_` prefix — those match base64url nonces and minified code. Ids are matched only in their
 *     bounded form: a house prefix and exactly 24 hex characters (`newHouseId` = prefix + `randomId(12)`).
 *
 * Words proposed by other areas (house stake, dau la nyumba, 平台投注, staff-chosen, staff edge, enter now, scorecard,
 * STAFF_EDGE and their sw/zh forms) are added ONLY after they are measured absent from clean `origin/main`'s client
 * bundle, client graph and signed-out served pages, and they land with the first client slot (ruling 175, 192) — not
 * before. A word that would go red on `origin/main` is recorded, never allowlisted.
